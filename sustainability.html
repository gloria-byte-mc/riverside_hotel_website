   <h1 style="color:black; text-align: center; ">Community</h1>
   <p style="color:black; text-align: center;">Riverside Hotel continues to give priority to the local communities living around our areas of operation so as to ensure economic independence with the end goal to better navigate uncertainty and thrive towards a sustainable livelihood in the future. Our properties focus on providing opportunity to the local community through: purchasing fresh food stuff; selling artifacts and handicrafts from various local community groups in our gift shops; and skills development and employment through work-training opportunities that allows youth to gain marketable skills leading to meaningful work. We enhance guest experience by exposing them to the diverse range of local cultures and ethnic groups through art, dance, song, musical and theatrical displays whilst economically empowering the local people. Other support initiatives includes provision of free medical consultation, health outreach programs and support through a broad range of charitable causes and community programs that takes the form of cash, food, clothing, visits to orphanages, hospitals, old-people's homes, homes for the physically or mentally challenged and other disadvantaged groups.<br><br>

Riverside Hotel works with schools around its properties in various ways to ensure children have a conducive environment for learning. This is achieved through a number of initiatives that influences positive attributes on a child, thus having a holistic positive impact on a childâ€™s upbringing and development that will, hopefully in the medium to long-term assist to gradually transform the quality of life for generations to come.</p>
